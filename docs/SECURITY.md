# Security & Data Governance Policy

The **AI-Guided Academic Project Progress Tracking Platform with Planning & Mentorship Assistance** platform implements defense-in-depth security standards to protect student academic intellectual property, user authentication credentials, and database integrity.

## 1. Security Architecture & Threat Mitigation

| Security Domain | Implemented Controls |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Authentication & Sessions** | Industry-standard JWT (JSON Web Tokens) with HMAC-SHA256 signing; 24-hour expiration token lifetime; secure bearer authorization headers. |
| **Password Storage** | Bcrypt cryptographic adaptive hashing with automatic salt generation (cost factor: 12). Plaintext passwords are never stored or logged. |
| **API Transport Security** | Strict CORS policy allowing only authorized client origins; input validation through Pydantic schemas rejecting unvalidated payloads. |
| **Data Isolation** | Relational data isolated per `student_id`; Pinecone vector embeddings partitioned using dedicated `project_{id}` namespaces. |
| **Secret Management** | Environment variables isolated via `.env` and `python-dotenv`. Zero hardcoding of API tokens or database URLs. |
| **LLM Prompt Injection Defense** | Sanitized user inputs with delimiters; system prompts structured with strict JSON schema constraints and output validators. |
