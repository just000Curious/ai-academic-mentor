## 📌 Project Overview & Problem Statement

Students frequently face significant challenges while selecting, planning, executing, and documenting academic projects. Many projects fail not because of technical difficulty, but due to **poor planning, unclear objectives, unrealistic timelines, improper technology selection, and insufficient mentorship**. Faculty members often supervise multiple teams simultaneously, limiting personalized guidance available to each student group.

The **AI-Guided Academic Project Progress Tracking Platform with Planning & Mentorship Assistance** is an intelligent, agentic platform that guides students through the complete academic project lifecycle:
1. A student submits a rough project idea in **2–3 lines**.
2. The platform automatically triggers a **multi-agent AI pipeline** that evaluates feasibility, defines scope, recommends optimal technology stacks, generates a week-wise milestone roadmap with Mermaid Gantt charts, and identifies execution risks — producing a complete project blueprint without additional prompting.
3. Post-planning, students interact conversationally for **ongoing guidance, progress tracking (dynamic plan adjustment), weekly check-ins, and on-demand academic documentation generation**.
4. Faculty mentors access a **dedicated monitoring dashboard** for passive, real-time oversight of all student projects, health indicators, and auto-generated weekly summaries.
